LSTM Based DQN

This network contains 2 networks namely-

1.Representation generator
2.Action Scorer

The Representation Generator is responsible for converting the raw test input to a feature vector using Long Short Term Memory Cell Recurrent Neural Network.

The Action Scorer is responsible for using neural network to predict the action taken in the text based game using Batch Based Q Learning Network using Epsilon Greedy Algorithm

RMSProp based optimizer is used along with Stochastic Gradient descent for Parameter tuning
